# WorkoutSession Project

This project focuses on practicing Python documentation and code organization rather than building complex functionality.

## Overview
The main goal of this assignment was to:
- Write clean, well-structured Python classes and methods
- Use docstrings effectively
- Generate professional documentation using **pydoc**

Rather than emphasizing advanced logic, the project emphasized:
- Clear function and class descriptions  
- Parameter and return value documentation  
- Understanding how tools like `pydoc` automatically generate readable API documentation from properly written docstrings

## Key Concepts
- Python classes and methods
- Docstring standards
- Auto-generated documentation with `pydoc`
- Software documentation best practices

## How to Generate Documentation
Run the following command in the project directory:

```bash
python3 -m pydoc -w fitness_tracker
```
